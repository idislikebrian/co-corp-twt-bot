# Cobalt Corp
Cobalt is an agency operating as a collective. More soon...

## Purpose

A study on aethetics. We've curated the images in the folder and are leaning on the Twitter audience to curate by 'liking' their favorites. If you want to create your own, clone this repo and follow the quickstart below.

## Quickstart

1. Run `npm install` in the terminal to install dependendencies (`cron`, `dotenv`, and `twit`)
2. Add your Twitter API credentials to `config.js`
4. Create a folder called `images` -- This is where you will store your images
5. Run `node server.js` in the terminal

### Roadmap
- Pinterest and Are.na integrations
