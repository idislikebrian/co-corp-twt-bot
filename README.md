Cobalt is an agency operating as a collective. More soon...

## Purpose

A study on aethetics. It is a collection of found content and knowledge, that is relevant for my research, which spans the concept of wabi-sabi, inflatable objects, and at the intersection on the constructivism and organicism movements. We've curated the images in the folder and are leaning on the Twitter audience to curate by 'liking' their favorites. 

If you want to create your own, clone this repo and follow the quickstart below.

## Quickstart

1. Run `npm install` in the terminal to install dependendencies (`cron`, `dotenv`, and `twit`)
2. Add your Twitter API credentials to `config.js`
4. Create a folder called `images` and inside of that folder, another called `used`-- You will store your images ins the `images` folder and they will get programatically archived in the `used` folder.
5. Run `node server.js` in the terminal

### Roadmap
- Pinterest and Are.na integrations
- ~~Programatically move photos that were already tweeted to a different folder~~
